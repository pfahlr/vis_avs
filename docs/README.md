# AVS Cross-Platform Port

This project aims to reimplement Winamp's Advanced Visualization Studio (AVS) as a standalone,
portable engine and tooling.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following packages are installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake g++ clang-format git pkg-config \
  libsdl2-dev mesa-common-dev libglu1-mesa-dev \
  portaudio19-dev libportaudio2 libgtest-dev libsamplerate0-dev \
  libjack-dev libasound2-dev
```

## Build Instructions

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd avs-cross-platform  # repository root
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
ctest
```

Run the stub player after building:

```bash
./apps/avs-player/avs-player [--sample-rate 48000] [--channels 2]
```

The runtime can request specific capture parameters when talking to PortAudio.
Use `--sample-rate` and `--channels` to ask the device for a particular format;
the player will fall back to the device defaults if the request is not
available and resample to the engine's 48 kHz internal representation.

Enumerate capture devices (and their numeric identifiers) via:

```bash
./apps/avs-player/avs-player --list-input-devices
```

Pick a device either by index or by matching part of its name:

```bash
./apps/avs-player/avs-player --input-device 2
./apps/avs-player/avs-player --input-device "USB"
```

If the chosen endpoint cannot capture audio, the player reports a descriptive
error instead of silently falling back to the default input.

To drive rendering from a WAV file, run the player in headless mode. Supplying
`--wav` without `--headless` will terminate with an error.

```bash
./apps/avs-player/avs-player --headless --wav tests/data/test.wav \
  --preset tests/data/simple.avs --frames 120 --out output_dir
```

More documentation will be added as the project evolves.
