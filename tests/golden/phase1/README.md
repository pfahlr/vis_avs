# Phase-one golden capture stubs

Each subdirectory corresponds to a preset from `tests/data/phase1/`.
Replace the README in each folder with the deterministic capture generated by
running the legacy renderer as described in `tests/data/phase1/README.md`.

Expected payload per preset:

- `hashes.txt` — the SHA256 digest list emitted by `avs-player --headless`
- `frame_00000.png` … `frame_00179.png` — raw framebuffer dumps for CI spot checks
- `preset.avs` — copy of the preset that produced the capture (kept in sync with
  the source tree)

The integration test pairs presets and goldens by shared directory name, so do
not rename these folders without updating the lookup logic.
