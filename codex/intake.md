# Codex Intake

- Primary instructions are in `AGENTS.md`.
- Actionable jobs live under `codex/jobs/*.yaml`.
- Follow the schema documented in AGENTS.md (id, title, status, labels, depends_on, goal, steps, acceptance_criteria, test_hook, files_touched).
- Respect `codex/policies.md` (no binaries in PRs; warnings as errors).
