# Legacy effect quarantine

This directory tracks implementations that do not yet have canonical
manifest coverage. Effect sources relocated here are excluded from the
compat registry and may require further design work before returning to
the supported pipeline. No quarantined sources are present yet; add
files here as additional non-canonical code is discovered.
