goal: >
  Remove duplicate and conflicting effect entries from effects_manifest.yaml to ensure registry
  consistency and prevent effect resolution ambiguity.
steps:
  - Remove duplicate trans/color_modifier entry (lines 161-167).
  - Investigate trans/color_clip conflict (lines 137-143 vs 153-159) by examining original source.
  - Determine if r_colorreplace.cpp and r_contrast.cpp are two different effects or same effect.
  - Keep only one trans/color_clip entry with correct original_file mapping.
  - Standardize unknown_render_object entries (ensure consistent namespace and category).
  - Validate manifest YAML syntax and check for any other duplicates.
acceptance_criteria:
  - No duplicate effect IDs in effects_manifest.yaml.
  - Each effect maps to exactly one original source file.
  - YAML parses without errors.
  - Effect registry loads all 56 effects without conflicts.
  - All required tests execute via ctest and pass.
test_hook:
  - "ctest: effects_registry_tests validates unique IDs and successful binding."
files_touched:
  - docs/effects_manifest.yaml
  - tests/effects_registry_tests.cpp
