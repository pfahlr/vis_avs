# Render / Bass Spin

`Render / Bass Spin` reacts to bass energy by spinning paired line or triangle arms around two
anchor points. The rotation speed follows the legacy Winamp AVS smoothing curve and uses the same
44-bin bass window to estimate energy. Each half of the effect can be enabled independently and
assigned its own color. The *Lines* mode draws trailing spokes while the *Triangles* mode fills the
area between consecutive samples, matching the visual look of the original module.
