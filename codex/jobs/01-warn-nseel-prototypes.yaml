title: Export NS-EEL parser prototypes
status: IN-REVIEW
labels: [warnings, ns-eel, build]
depends_on: []
goal: >
  Eliminate -Wimplicit-function-declaration in C builds by ensuring nseellex/nseelerror
  prototypes are visible to the generated parser and C consumers.
steps:
  - Create libs/third_party/ns-eel/nseel_lexer_decls.h declaring nseellex/nseelerror with
    conditional signatures (#ifdef NSEEL_SUPER_MINIMAL_LEXER) and extern "C" guards.
  - Replace ad-hoc prototypes in ns-eel-int.h with #include "nseel_lexer_decls.h".
  - Include the header from y.tab.c right after the existing include block.
  - Rebuild ns-eel static lib with -Werror.
acceptance_criteria:
  - Build passes with -Werror=implicit-function-declaration and no duplicate-prototype warnings.
  - All required tests execute via ctest and pass.
test_hook:
  - "Configure C and C++ builds with -Werror; run ctest."
files_touched:
  - libs/third_party/ns-eel/y.tab.c
  - libs/third_party/ns-eel/ns-eel-int.h
  - libs/third_party/ns-eel/nseel_lexer_decls.h
