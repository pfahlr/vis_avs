title: Fix extended render-list header skipping
status: READY
labels: [presets, bugfix, parser]
depends_on: []
goal: >
  Correct the off-by-8 skip in extended render-list headers by parsing fields explicitly.
steps:
  - Replace extendedSize+4 skipping with explicit deserialization of the eight 32-bit fields.
  - Add fixture with extended header and validate the first effect ID is read correctly.
  - Document the legacy "size includes +4" quirk in code comments.
acceptance_criteria:
  - First effect in nested render lists is parsed correctly; no misalignment of payloads.
test_hook:
  - "New tests/data/extended_header.avs passes parse and render sanity checks."
files_touched:
  - libs/avs-core/src/preset.cpp
  - tests/data/extended_header.avs
  - tests/avs_core_tests.cpp
